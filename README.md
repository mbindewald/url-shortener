# Requirements
  - Users can create a new shortened url by going to {site_address}/new/{user_url}. The shortened url will be returned by this
  - When users go to {site_address}/{shortened_url}, they will be redirected to the {user_url} that corresponds with the {shortened_url}

# Current status
  - Fully functional, not very pretty
  - Need to update regex to only work for http:// and https://
  - Need to make it pretty
